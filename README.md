# Silent Failure in HTML: Modifying Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML where attempting to modify the `innerHTML` of a non-existent element results in a silent failure.  The script doesn't throw an error, but it also doesn't produce the expected result.

The bug is demonstrated in `bug.html`, and the solution is in `bugSolution.html`.

The issue highlights the importance of checking for the existence of elements before manipulating them to prevent unexpected behavior and silent failures.
